        You should now have a decent idea of what an About Us page should and shouldn’t contain.

We’re going to follow this with a few tips to help you stand out and create an About Us page that works for you and your business.

Be creative. Don’t fall into the trap of simply writing a brief summary of your business and calling it a day. The best About Us pages are creative, informative, and interesting.
Don’t follow the crowd. If someone’s reading your About page, there’s a good chance they’ve been reading (or will read) your competitors’ About Us pages. So, make sure your page stands out. It should make it almost impossible for a potential customer to forget you.
Feature faces. Consumers like to know who they’re buying from or working with, so make sure to feature at least some of your team on your About page. It can really help boost conversions.
Oh, and never use stock photography. Ever.

Be transparent. Your About Us page serves to sell your story and get buy-in from your visitors. Transparency is incredibly important to win your visitors’ trust.
Don’t forget about CTAs. Like any other page, About Us pages need calls to action. Many sites seem to forget that this is a key page for converting visitors. Make it clear to readers what you want them to do next.
