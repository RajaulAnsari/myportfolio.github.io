        A few weeks ago, we published a blog article featuring 15 examples of brilliant homepage design. And man was it popular! Not even a full three weeks later, the article has already attracted more than 36,000 views. Now, before you accuse us of getting all cocky on you, you should know the other side to the story.

Albeit successful, many of the readers of that post ... or at least the ones who like leaving blog comments ;-) ... were disappointed in the lack of industry variety in the examples we showcased, since a lot of them featured homepages of software companies. So ... what's a marketer to do? We could either ignore your complaints, or we could follow The Kinks' lead and "give the people what they want."

Download our full collection of website homepage examples here to inspire your own homepage design.
Agreeing that the latter was a much better choice, we pulled together a downloadable collection of 50 Examples of Brilliant Homepage Design, which features homepage examples from a variety of industries ... not just software. So let's highlight some of our absolute favorites from this collection here, and talk about what makes them so great so you can get some solid inspiration for your next homepage redesign. And if you're looking for more examples, you can always download the complete collection here.
