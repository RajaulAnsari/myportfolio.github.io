        <i>What is Web Design?</i>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family:calibri">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually<br/>
    refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software<br/>
    development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop<br/>
    browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has<br/>
    become ever-increasingly important.
